# GuessingGame
```
This game is simmilar to Akinator.To see Akinator, please go to http://en.akinator.com/ 
This guessing game is about dorms in Mount Holyoke College. The game will ask the user to pick a dorm from Mount Holyoke College and it will ask some questions to determine which dorm the user is thinking of. The user can only answer yes or no to these questions.
```

**Restriced version**
```
The game will ask the user a bunch of questions and the game would display certian pictures when it wins or loses the game.
```
**Unrestricted version**
```
Based on restriced version, the game will additionally "learn" the item that it guessed wrong by asking the user to type in the item name and a question, then the game puts the item into its database.
```
**Data Structure**
```
I use the data in a pre-designed XML file which contains the questions and the items.
The Binary Tree is used for making the decisions according to the user's answer.
In this repository, I include the Binary Tree code, my previous work, which has traversal functions based on seven dwarfs in Snow White.

**Code Reference**
